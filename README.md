# Flower Shop Webpage

This is a simple and elegant webpage for a flower shop, built using HTML and CSS. It showcases the shop's products, provides information about the shop, and allows users to contact the shop.

## Features Used

### HTML

-   **Semantic HTML5 elements:**  `header`,  `nav`,  `main`,  `article`,  `footer`, etc. for better structure and SEO.
-   **Bootstrap 5 Grid System:** Used for creating responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
-   **Forms:**  A contact form is implemented using  `form`,  `input`, and  `button`  elements.
-   **Media Elements:**  `video`  element is used to embed a background video with autoplay and loop functionality.

### CSS

-   **External Stylesheet:**  `cadbury.css`  is used to keep the styling organized and separate from the HTML.
-   **Responsive Design:** Media queries are used to ensure the layout looks good on various screen sizes, particularly for mobile devices.
-   **Flexbox:** Used for flexible and efficient layout of elements, especially in the navigation bar, about section, and product cards.
-   **CSS Variables:**  `--pink`  variable is used for consistent color theming.
-   **Hover Effects:** Subtle hover effects are added to elements like buttons and product images for better user interaction.
-   **Background Images and Videos:**  The banner section utilizes a background image, and the "About Us" section uses a background video for a visually appealing design.
-   **Font Styling:** Custom fonts are imported from Google Fonts to enhance the overall aesthetic.
-   **Shadows and Borders:**  Box shadows and rounded borders are applied to certain elements like product cards to provide depth and visual separation.
